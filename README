This is an Android implementation of the LODE Client.

LODE is a software for low-cost acquisition of lectures (specially if based on slide presentations).
The (good quality) audio and video (640x480 pixels, interpolated) can be accompanied by images of 
the slides projected in class (for Power-Point-based lectures), and by tools for navigating the 
lecture (by section title, by other indexes or through a time-bar). LODE also allows attaching 
arbitrary documents to any point of the lecture. Also, it allows producing DVDs with a whole course 
on it (a full 50 hours course nicely fits on a single DVD). Single lectures can also be downloaded 
from the Internet.
